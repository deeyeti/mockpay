MockPay — Payment Gateway Simulator​
Software Requirements Specification 
(SRS) 
1. Introduction 
1.1 Purpose 
MockPay is a developer-focused payment gateway simulation platform that allows 
developers to test payment flows, webhooks, and failure scenarios without using real 
money. This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements of the 
system. 
1.2 Scope 
The system will allow merchants to create accounts and projects, generate fake API keys, 
create and simulate payments, simulate success/failure/timeout scenarios, send webhooks, 
and provide an analytics dashboard. 
1.3 Users 
Target users include developers, students, and startup teams testing payment integrations. 
2. Overall Description 
MockPay consists of a web dashboard for merchants and a backend API that simulates a 
payment gateway. It supports project management, API key authentication, payment 
creation, webhook dispatching, and analytics. 
3. Functional Requirements 
3.1 Authentication System 
FR-1: The system shall allow user signup and login.​
FR-2: The system shall support JWT-based authentication.​
FR-3: The system shall allow a user to create and manage multiple projects. 
3.2 Project & API Key Management 
FR-4: The user shall be able to create projects.​
FR-5: The system shall generate a unique API key per project.​
FR-6: The API key shall be required for all API calls and stored securely (hashed). 

3.3 Payment Creation API 
FR-7: The system shall expose an endpoint POST /api/payments/create.​
FR-8: The API shall accept amount, currency, customer_email, and redirect_url.​
FR-9: The system shall return payment_url and payment_id. 
3.4 Hosted Payment Page 
FR-10: The payment URL shall open a hosted payment page.​
FR-11: The user shall be able to choose the outcome: success, failure, or timeout. 
3.5 Payment Processing 
FR-12: The system shall update and persist the payment status.​
FR-13: The system shall store all payments in the database. 
3.6 Webhook System 
FR-14: The merchant shall be able to configure a webhook URL.​
FR-15: The system shall send a POST request to the webhook on payment status change.​
FR-16: The webhook shall include a signature header.​
FR-17: The system shall retry failed webhook deliveries. 
3.7 Dashboard & Analytics 
FR-18: The user shall see total volume, success rate, and failure rate.​
FR-19: The user shall be able to filter analytics by date range. 
4. Non-Functional Requirements 
NFR-1: The system shall respond to API calls within 300 ms under normal load.​
NFR-2: The system shall securely store API keys.​
NFR-3: The system shall support at least 1000 concurrent payments.​
NFR-4: The system shall log all significant events. 
5. Data Models 
User(id, email, password_hash)​
Project(id, user_id, name)​
ApiKey(id, project_id, hash)​
Payment(id, project_id, amount, status, created_at)​
Webhook(id, project_id, url, secret) 
6. System Architecture 
The system consists of a React-based dashboard, a Node.js API server, a database, and a 
webhook dispatcher module. The frontend communicates with the backend API, which 
stores data in the database and dispatches webhooks to merchant servers.
